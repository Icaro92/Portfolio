### [Sales Prediction based on Marketing Spend](https://github.com/Icaro92/MMxM)

* This project's objective was to predict a company's Sales based on its investments in Facebook, YouTube, and Newspapers.
* Through a very straightforward approach I managed to build a model that correctly predicts Sales 90% of the time.
* The data was obtained online from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muyiwawilliams/advertising-dataset/data).
